# Vehicle Rental System - Database Design & SQL Queries
## Overview & Objectives

This assignment is designed to evaluate your understanding of database table design, ERD relationships and SQL queries. You will work with a simplified Vehicle Rental System database.

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:
- Design an ERD with **1 to 1**, **1 to Many** and **Many to 1** relationships
- Understand primary keys and foreign keys
- Write SQL queries using JOIN, EXISTS and WHERE

## Database Design & Business Logic

The system manages:

- **Users**
- **Vehicles**
- **Bookings**

### Business Logic - What Your Database Must Handle

Your database design should support these real world scenarios:

#### Users Table Must Store:
- User role (Admin or Customer)
- Name, email, password, phone number
- Each email must be unique (no duplicate accounts)

#### Vehicles Table Must Store:
- Vehicle name, type (car/bike/truck), model
- Registration number (must be unique)
- Rental price per day
- Availability status (available/rented/maintenance)

#### Bookings Table Must Store:
- Which user made the booking (link to Users table)
- Which vehicle was booked (link to Vehicles table)
- Start date and end date of rental
- Booking status (pending/confirmed/completed/cancelled)
- Total cost of the booking

## Part 1: ERD Design (Mandatory)
> Note: You must submit your ERD in the submission otherwise you will get 0 marks.

Design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Vehicle Rental System.

### Required Tables

You must include the following tables:

- Users
- Vehicles
- Bookings

### Relationship Requirements

Your ERD must clearly show:

- **One to Many**: User → Bookings
- **Many to One**: Bookings → Vehicle
- **One to One (logical)**: Each booking connects exactly one user and one vehicle

### ERD Must Include

- Primary Keys (PK)
- Foreign Keys (FK)
- Relationship cardinality
- Status fields (e.g. booking status, vehicle availability)

### Submission Format

You need to submit your ERD as:
- [Lucidchart ERD Tool](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/er-diagram-tool) 
- Submit a public, shareable ERD link.

## Part 2: SQL Queries

Write SQL queries based on your designed schema.

> **Check Sample Input/Output**: To understand the expected results for each query, please refer to the **[Sample Query Results (QUERY.md)](QUERY.md)** file.


### Query 1: JOIN

Retrieve booking information along with:

- Customer name
- Vehicle name

**Concepts used**: INNER JOIN

### Query 2: EXISTS

Find all vehicles that have never been booked.

**Concepts used**: NOT EXISTS

### Query 3: WHERE

Retrieve all available vehicles of a specific type (e.g. cars).

**Concepts used**: SELECT, WHERE

### Query 4: GROUP BY and HAVING

Find the total number of bookings for each vehicle and display only those vehicles that have more than 2 bookings.

**Concepts used**: GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT

## Part 3: Theory Questions (Viva Practice - Progress, Not Perfection)
> **Note:** Answer the questions in your own words and record them on camera in Bengali or English. Spend about two minutes on each question.

> "This video is a safe space to practice - confidence grows every time you speak."


#### Question 1
What is a foreign key and why is it important in relational databases?

#### Question 2
What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses in SQL?

#### Question 3
What is a primary key and what are its characteristics?

#### Question 4
What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL?
